# Coding-Quiz

## Description

A short, timed, quiz website where users can test their programming knowledge by answering a series of questions.

## Features
* Multiple-choice questions: The website presents a series of multiple-choice questions to the users, allowing them to select one option as their answer.

## Lessons Learned
* No sane person would volountarily navigate the DOM with the default commands.
* Pay attention to your bash windows or you'll think you're adding commits, when in reality you're updating your class activities repo. Like I did.

* The reset.css file was taken from the UC Berkley Coding bootcamp lecture materials, from the section discussing CSS-resets. I did not author this file.
